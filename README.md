# nflRadarCharts 

Description

Group collaboration project to design and implement a website that displays nfl stats for all nfl teams from seasons 2002 through 2022. After the user inputs their teams/seasons, the program displays seasonal rankings via radar chart, and further displays raw stats for a given team/season(e.g., points for, rushing yards, team MVP, etc.).



Motivation

After taking a course that demonstrated the features of Pandas, we decided to create a project that could showcase what we learned. With this being our first-time collaborating on a coding project, we quickly learned the ins and outs of combining our code.  We were able to divide the work-load (according to our strengths) and utilized the Flask framework to wrap it all into a package that is now being displayed on pythonanywhere.com.
