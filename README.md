# nflRadarCharts
Project Completion: April 2023

## Description

**nflRadarCharts** is a collaborative project designed to create a website that displays NFL statistics for all NFL teams from seasons 2002 through 2022. Users can input their preferred teams and seasons, and the program will generate seasonal rankings using radar charts. It also provides access to raw stats for a given team and season, including data such as points scored, rushing yards, and the team's MVP.

## Motivation

The project was born out of our collective desire to apply our knowledge of Pandas, which we acquired during a course. This project serves as a showcase of what we've learned. As a first-time collaborative coding project, it presented the perfect opportunity to combine our skills. We efficiently divided the workload based on our strengths and harnessed the Flask framework to package and host the project, which is now accessible on pythonanywhere.com.
